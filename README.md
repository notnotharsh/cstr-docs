# 2020 CSTR - Flare Project Code
The following consists of code I wrote to assist with the flare project of the 2020 Junior Research Associate Summer Internship Program. Specifically, the Google Apps Script files assist in logging and storing data efficiently by generating formulas to process handling data input in a very specific format.

## X-Ray
The xray.gs file is Google Apps Script code that manages efficient logging of data pertaining to plasma temperature, plasma density, emission measure, and relative deviation of the February 16, 2014 solar flare across 33 different time frames covering about 8 minutes in total.

## Microwave
The microwave.gs file is intended for the same purpose, but with a separate rendering engine and reference spectrum (meant for lower frequency data tracked during this solar flare). The time interval the data handled by this file is meant to cover is a set of 36 time frames covering 36 seconds total.
